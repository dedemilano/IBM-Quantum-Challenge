Lab 0 overview
In this lab, we'll focus on teaching you how to use these challenge notebooks, how to grade your work, and how to manage the general flow of setting up, running, and evaluating the results of your quantum code.

To complete this and the other labs, you'll need to know a little bit about the Python programming language. Each lab contains a mixture of tutorial content, pre-written code blocks, and challenge code blocks that require you to fill in your own Qiskit code. To complete an exercise, you'll need to type the required code underneath each line that has the ## Write your code below here ## comment.

It's important to note that you should run each code cell, even if you didn't write any new code there. This ensures that when you submit your answers later on, everything is up to date. There will be one or two exceptions to this rule, depending on what type of computer you are using.


Welcome to lab one! This lab is designed to introduce you to some of the new capabilities and functions of Qiskit 1.0. Later challenges will develop on these capabilities further and introduce the more complex new Qiskit functionalities.

Through this lab you will learn how to set up quantum states using Qiskit, and how to implement an optimization algorithm using VQE. These two tasks will be set in two sections:

Qiskit states, the new and the old
VQE with Qiskit 1.0
Let's get started!
